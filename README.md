Q. The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yards medley 
relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in 
more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmers should be assigned to each of the four 
strokes. The five fastest swimmers and best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of 
the strokes (for 50 yards) are;
Stroke        Carl Chris David Tony Ken
Backstroke    37.7 32.9  33.8       35.4
Breaststroke  33.1       42.2  34.7 41.8
Butterfly     33.3 38.9  28.5  30.4 33.6
Freestyle     29.2 26.4  29.6  28.5
The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to 
minimize the sum of the corresponding best times.
It is also noted that Tony doesn’t know backstroke, Chris doesn’t know breast stroke & Ken 
doesn’t perform freestyle.
a) Formulate this problem as an assignment problem
b) Obtain an optimal solution.
